## My research

I am interested in understanding the physics of low-mass objects, from cool dwarf stars to planets, with a strong focus on time-domain wide-field projects.

### Exoplanets and Browns dwarfs

Planets might be detected in two ways: Transiting planets, which leave a signature in the light curves, and microlensing events, which will show anomalies in the presence of a planet. Brown dwarfs are interesting because they can show variabilities in their flux due to weather patterns and changes in their astrometric position due to unseen companions.  

### Very-low mass stars

The estimation of parameters and properties of an exoplanet are connected to the stellar host. Understanding the stellar physics and inferring precise stellar parameters is therefore essential. These late-type stars pose a challenge as their physical parameters cannot be modeled very well, i.e., models under-predict the stellar radius and over-predict the effective temperature. 

### Rubin Observatory

Currently, I am assessing the performance of the LSST pipeline in crowded fields, therefore I analyze DECam images with the pipeline. During the early commissioning phase, I plan to evaluate the photometric and astrometric quality of the commissioning images. My aim is to understand the different noise components and correlations present in the data set, like e.g., systematic noise in the time series. I am interested in evaluating the astrometric errors and understanding their limitations with respect to high proper motion objects.
